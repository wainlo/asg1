            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>
                MusicQuest was founded in 2015 by Sarah Lin and Mark Thompson, two passionate music enthusiasts from different corners of the world. Sarah, a classically trained pianist, and Mark, a self-taught guitarist, discovered early in their musical journeys that access to quality, affordable music education was a significant barrier for many aspiring musicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their shared frustration with the lack of accessible music education resources led them to create MusicQuest, a platform designed to bridge the gap between formal music instruction and self-learning. They envisioned a space where learners could engage with high-quality content, structured lessons, and a supportive, global community that made music education approachable and enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
                After months of collaboration with educators, technologists, and musicians, MusicQuest was born. What started as a small project has now grown into a global platform that empowers people of all ages to pursue their musical dreams.
